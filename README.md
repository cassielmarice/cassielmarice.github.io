<p> My notes: A very hearty meal that can be pretty oily and unhealthy. I like the aspect of it being served on a sizzling plate because it keeps the dish hot even when it's served. However, if eaten in moderation it's good. </p>

<p>Rating: ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ </p>
<P> My notes: Not the most visually pleasing dish, but looks can be deceiving. Personally, the flavor reminds me of curry, which is something I like. However, the leaves get stuck in my teeth and it can be hard to get out. </P>
