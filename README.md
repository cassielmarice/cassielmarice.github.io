<p>Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ </p>
<p> Cassiel's notes: A very hearty meal that can be pretty oily and unhealthy. I like the aspect of it being served on a sizzling plate because it keeps the dish hot even when it's served. However, if eaten in moderation it's good. </p>

<p>Rating: ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ </p>
<P> Cassiel's notes: Not the most visually pleasing dish, but looks can be deceiving. Personally, the flavor reminds me of curry, which is something I like. However, the leaves get stuck in my teeth and it can be hard to get out. </P>

 <p> My notes: My family likes to get the party platter of palabok on special occasions like birthdays, so this dish is associated with happy memories. While I don't love shrimp, I enjoy the crunchy bits of chicharron and the tangy flavor of the sauce.</p>
